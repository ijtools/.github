## ijTools

ijTools is a collection of plugins for the ImageJ/Fiji platform. Some of them have specialized aims and/or are focussed on processing of specific project data.

Short curated list of rather stable projects:

### Plugins
* [RegionFeaturesJ](https://github.com/ijtools/RegionFeaturesJ): an ImageJ library for computing features for regions stored in a label map.
* [ijGranulometry](https://github.com/ijtools/ijGranulometry): a library that allows to apply grayscale granulometry using mathematical morphology operators. Requires the MorphoLibJ library.
* [Digital Shapes](https://github.com/ijtools/ijDigiShapes) A collection of plugins for generating discretized version of classical geometric shapes in 2D (disks, ellipses, oriented boxes...) and in 3D (balls, elllipsoids, cuboids, cylinders...).
* [binaryMorphology](https://github.com/ijtools/binary-morphology): implementation of morphological filters for binary images relying on distance maps. Can be faster for large values of structuring element radius.
* [Rotated Crop Plugin](https://github.com/ijtools/ijRotatedCrop) Crop 2D/3D images with various box orientations.
* [ScaleBar3d](https://github.com/ijtools/ScaleBar3d) Simple plugin to add a Scale Bar to 3D images, as a 3D cylinder.

### Libraries
* [ijGeometry](https://github.com/ijtools/ijGeometry) a Geometry library for ImageJ
* [sliding-strel](https://github.com/ijtools/sliding-strel) Morphological dilation and erosion using sliding structuring elements
  
### Utilities
* [imagej-plugin-template](https://github.com/ijtools/imagej-plugin-template): template project to quickly create new plugins for ImageJ.

Libraries usually use the "net.ijt" base package name, and a short name for package root. Examples: "net.ijt.geom", "net.ijt.regfeat"...
