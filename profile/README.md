## ijTools

ijTools is a collection of plugins for the ImageJ/Fiji platform. Some of them have specialized aims and/or are focussed on processing of specific project data.

Short curated list of rather stable projects:

* [ijGranulometry](https://github.com/ijtools/ijGranulometry): a library that allows to apply grayscale granulometry using mathematical morphology operators. Requires the MorphoLibJ library.
* [binaryMorphology](https://github.com/ijtools/binary-morphology): implementation of morphological filters for binary images relying on distance maps. Can be faster for large values of structuring element radius.
* [imagej-plugin-template](https://github.com/ijtools/imagej-plugin-template): template project to quickly create new plugins for ImageJ.
